# Welcome

My projects and one month's trading record is here. Additional trading record available upon request.

PDFs with mathematical term as title are my university projects. They intend to show that I can program correctly. I suggest start from Primality.pdf or ContinuedFraction.pdf since these are interesting topics. 

The two png files are the translated trading results. One shows overall result, the other shows how I got the result(PNL curve). The point is that I do not profit by sheer luck. 

The full trading record of Feb is the pdf with Chinese name. Chinese is required to understand trading details.
